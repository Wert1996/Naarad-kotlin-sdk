# Naarad-kotlin-sdk

For documentation on how to use this SDK, you can refer here: [Documentation](https://d3bhwtjk5vuhv4.cloudfront.net/docs).

This repo also contains an example application under the `app` folder. The app uses the Naarad module to integrate with the Naarad SDK. The process used is also detailed in the docs above.
